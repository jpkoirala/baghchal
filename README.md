# Baghchal

 [Baghchal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagh-Chal) is two-player strategic classical game played in 5 X 5 grid in Nepal (and India too).

The following is a c-program where you can play this game with the computer (in terminal). The game can be played with computer. I have implemented minimax algorithm in the game. I wrote this program when I was in Bachelors (around in 2013). I did not know about bitboard and other advanced stuff when I wrote this. This might be helpful for beginner programmar.

Tested with GCC in Ubuntu and OS X.

Just run: `makefile;./run` to run on terminal.
